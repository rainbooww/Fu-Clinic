                    <p>Xiao cares about you as a patient, not as a customer. Pay no attention to the negative (and quite honestly, false) reviews by those who have no idea how the insurance game works. I have worked in healthcare for 10 years. And I know a genuinely caring and sincere provider when I meet one.  I will be coming back regularly.

                        I have rarely had to wait here, and never more than just a few minutes. She handles the practice efficiently and quickly. Very affordable. Xiao listens to you, does not speak down to you, unlike many doctors I have dealt with in the past.

                      I visited Xiao at Carrboro Family Clinic for the first time years ago on a weekend to avoid a costly emergency room visit. I was so pleased with her professionalism, advice, and care that she provided me. I have returned to her numerous times, as have my husband and daughter.
                      She always takes the time to thoroughly explain options and provides both holistic and traditional western medical options. I highly recommend.</p>

                      <p>I've been seeing Xiao at Carrboro Family Clinic for many years and feel so lucky to have found her. (I moved to the area as a student and didn't have a local physician.) I first started seeing her for urgent-care type issues but she's now become the person I see for nearly everything. I've seen my health improve thanks to her time, attention, and skills...

                          Xiao is a thoughtful communicator and can be as sensitive and funny, as she is efficient and direct. She sees me promptly and I've never had any issues with billing/claims/insurance.  I look forward to my monthly appointment because I know I'll be taken care of by someone who genuinely cares for me, her patients and her practice.

                      <p>I've gone to see Xiao 3 or 4 times. It's all drop-in and I've never waited more than 15 minutes before getting help. She gives very holistic care and never will just send you home with a prescription. She tries to help you figure out why you're having a particular ailment and treat the cause as well as the symptoms.
                          The first time I went to see her, I believe there was a little bigger copay than normal to get me on the books and make sure my insurance would cover the visit.

                      <p>This is the best Dr in Carrboro. There is 1 Dr. here, she is also the owner. You can tell how she will care for you when you walk in and see how she cares for her own business. She is proud of it and she is proud to have the privilege to care for others. Don't let the fact that this a walk-in clinic fool you. This is top shelf health care with an eye on detail. You're not a customer, you're a patient.
