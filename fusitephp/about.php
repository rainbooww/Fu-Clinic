                    <p style="font-size:0.9em">  Xiao Fu completed the FNP/MSN program at the UNC Chapel Hill School of Nursing in 2006. In 2008, she ran an urgent care clinic in Smithfield, NC and served in a 30 bed Durham, NC, acute rehabilitation facility. "My last two jobs have been very challenging and I have proven that I have the ability to deliver safe and quality medical care at an independent urgent care clinic and at an impatient hospital setting." Now, Xiao, FNP, MSA, RN, ANCC, has stepped into the role of owner of a FNP-managed clinic. She promises excellent care for all and walk-ins are welcome.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p style="font-size:0.9em"> What makes her different is that she has 30 years of international nursing experience having worked in China, the Middle East, Canada and the U.S, this gives her a unique perspective. Family nurse practitioners like Xiao have a broad range of training and education which provide a wide range of services to a large base of patients, including evaluation, diagnosis, treatment, educating, risk assessment, health promotion, care managment, coordination of care and service with other disciplines as needed. In this era of increasing primary care needs and high level of primary care physician shortages, nurse practitioner like Xiao, are educated and trained to meet the health care needs of individuals and families. </p>

                            <small> Always ask yourself: what can you do for people, communities, and your country? I serve people and communities around me as much as I can. I try to do good always and do no harm. I choose safe, quality medical care over what is popular with a clear conscience. I serve with an open heart and open mind as well as an open ear. I always remember that I deal with human beings who have strengths and weaknesses as I do. I am grateful for being a NP and face daily challenges, then forgive, forget, and move on. I will learn and grow as long as I live and promote good health, attitude, a healthy lifestyle, simplicity, and practicality. Be positive always, do what you can for good, ask for help as needed. Live well, laugh often, love always, live simply, speak kindly. Care deeply, love generously, laugh as much as you breathe and love as long as you live. </small>
